# linux_based
I have given a scenario that a customer requires a custom command to enhance their system administration capabilities. My Task was to develop a Bash Script that act as a Linux command to manage system resources effectively.
Command Name : sysopctl
Command Version : v0.1.0
We have the following operations or commands to build :
-> List Running Services
-> View System load
-> Check Disk Usage
-> Monitor System Processes
-> Analyze Sytem Logs
-> Bacup System Files
